Parrot Security ( https://www.parrotsec.org/features.fx )
Security GNU/Linux distribution designed with cloud pentesting and IoT security in mind.

It includes a full portable laboratory for security and digital forensics experts, but it also includes all you need to develop your own software or protect your privacy with anonymity and crypto tools.

Versions and Updates
1.0 Initial Document


The install process will have you do a few things:
●    Create a root password (so we don't have the default toor)
●    Create a new normal user, with their own password (so you don't run things as root all the time)
●    If you encrypt that VM hard drive (and you should), you will set an Encryption passphrase

Display Resolution
●    System -> Preferences -> Hardware -> Displays
●    It defaults to 1024x768
●    Only has a few choices ... investigating how to force a better resolution
Research on this so far:


    Use cvt to calculate the parameters needed by xrandr:

    cvt 1366 768

    example output:

    # 1368x768 59.88 Hz (CVT) hsync: 47.79 kHz; pclk: 85.25 MHz
    Modeline "1368x768_60.00"   85.25  1368 1440 1576 1784  768 771 781 798 -hsync +vsync

    build the xrandr command with the output of cvt:

    xrandr --newmode "1366x768" 85.25  1368 1440 1576 1784  768 771 781 798 -Hsync +Vsync

    please note Hsync and Vsync capitalized. I needed to do that to get things working on some systems

    Add a newmode in xrandr:

    xrandr --addmode VGA1 "1366x768"

    Replace VGA1 as needed

    Enable the new resolution:

    xrandr --output VGA1 --mode "1366x768"
